## Why container orchestration tool is necessary
What if you have 20 or 30 containers running?
* resources still available?
* schedule next container?
* are containers crashed?
* remove multiple replicas?

Pod - abstraction of containers
Service - when pod dies, new pod will have new ip. not good. so we have service. it has permanent IP address. lifecycle of Pod and Service is not connected. You specify the service type on creation. There are `external and internal` service. `internal` service is default type
Ingress - route traffic to cluster (forward request to service)

ConfigMap
            external configuration
Secret

Volume - data persistance

Deployment - 
StatufulSet - stateful application like DB, but it is not easy to manage in k8s, usually it is housed outside k8s

k8s configuration goes to master node api-server do make deployment happen.<br>
Each configuration file has 3 parts
1) meta
2) specification
3) status (automatically generated and added by k8s)

```k8s
# nginx-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
    name: nginx-deployment
    lables: ...
spec:
    replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template
    selector: ...
    template: ...
```
```k8s
# nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: V1
kind: Service
metadata:
    name: nginx-service
spec:
    selector: ...
    ports: ...
```

Attributes of "spec" are specific to the kind (for above 2 examples: Deployment&Service)

```k8s
status:
    availableReplicas: 1
    conditions:
    - lastTransitionTime: 
      lastUpdateTime:
      message: Deployment has minimum availability
      reason: MinimumReplicasAvailable
      status: "True"
      type: Available
    - lastTransitionTime:
      lastUpdateTime:
      message: ReplicaSet "nginx-deployment-78abc31
      reason: NewReplicaSetAvailable
      status: "True"
      type: Progressing
    observedGeneration: 1
    readyReplicas: 1
    replicas: 1
    updatedReplicas: 1
```
k8s update status continuously. It will compare deployment file and status to take corresponding actions like create 1 more replica.<br>
status data lives in `etcd`
