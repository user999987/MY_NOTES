# Organizing, Visualizing, and Describing Data
## SECTION 2 DATA TYPES
### Numerical versus Categorical Data
From a statistical perspective, data can be classified into two basic groups: numerical data(数值数据) and categorical data(分类数据).
1. Numerical Data: are values that represent measured or counted quantities as a number and are also called quantitative data. It can be split into continuous data and discrete data.
2. Categorical Data: (also called qualitative data) are values that describe a quality or characteristic of a group of observations and therefore can be used as labels to divide a dataset into groups to summarize and visualize.
    * Nominal data: are not amenable to being organized in a logical order. no inherent order or ranking. Like gender, color, martial status etc. Often, financial models, such as regression models, require input data to be numerical; so, nominal data in the input dataset must be coded numerically before applying an algorithm (that is, a process for problem solving) for performing the analysis. 
    * Ordinal data: are categorical values that can be logically ordered or ranked.
### Cross-Sectional versus Time-Series versus Panel Data
Another data classification standard is based on how data are collected. 
* Variable: a characteristic or quantity that can be measured, counted, or categorized and is subject to change. A variable can also be called a field, an attribute, or a feature. 
* Observation: is the value of a specific variable collected at a point in time or over a specific period of time.
1. Cross-sectional data: a list of the observations of a specific variable from multiple observational units at a given point in time. 
2. Time-series data: are a sequence of observations for a single observational unit of a specific variable collected over time and at discrete and typically equally spaced intervals of time, such as daily, weekly, monthly, annually, or quarterly. 
3. Panel data: are a mix of time-series and cross-sectional data that are frequently used in financial analysis and modeling

### Structured versus Unstructured Data
1. Structured data: are highly organized in a pre-defined manner, usually with repeating patterns.Typical examples of structured com- pany financial data are:
    * Market data: data issued by stock exchanges, such as intra-day and daily closing stock prices and trading volumes.
    * Fundamental data: data contained in financial statements, such as earnings per share, price to earnings ratio, dividend yield, and return on equity.
    * Analytical data: data derived from analytics, such as cash flow projections or forecasted earnings growth.

2. Unstructured data: are data that do not follow any conventionally organized forms. Some common types of unstructured data are text—such as financial news, posts in social media, and company filings with regulators—and also audio/ video, such as managements' earnings calls and presentations to analysts.

Unstructured data are a relatively new classification driven by the rise of alternative data (i.e., data generated from unconventional sources, like electronic devices, social media, sensor networks, and satellites, but also by companies in the normal course of business) and its growing adoption in the financial industry.By indicating the source from which the data are generated, such data can be classified into three groups:
* Produced by individuals (i.e., via social media posts, web searches, etc.);
* Generated by business processes (i.e., via credit card transactions, corporate
regulatory filings, etc.); and
* Generated by sensors (i.e., via satellite imagery, foot traffic by mobile devices, etc.).\
Unstructured data may offer new market insights not normally contained in data from traditional sources and may provide potential sources of returns for investment processes. Typically, financial models are able to take only structured data as inputs; therefore, unstructured data must first be transformed into structured data that models can process.

The SEC has utilized eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) to structure data.The data extracted from the XBRL submission can be organized into five tab-delimited TXT format files that contain information about the submission, including taxonomy `tags` (i.e., financial statement items), `dates`, units of measure (`uom`), `values` (i.e., for the tag items), and more—making it readable by computer.

### Data Summarization
Raw data can be organized into two typ- ical formats for quantitative analysis: one-dimensional arrays and two-dimensional rectangular arrays.
1. one-dimensional array
2. two-dimensional rectangular array: also called a data table

## SECTION 4 SUMMARIZING DATA USING FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS
![frequency_distribution](model_02_frequency_distribution.png)
* absolute frequency: or simply the raw frequency, is the actual number of obser- vations counted for each unique value of the variable
* relative frequency (in the third column), which is calculated as the absolute frequency of each unique value of the variable divided by the total number of observations.

1. assume we have `−4.57, −4.04, −1.64, 0.28, 1.34, 2.35, 2.38, 4.28, 4.42, 4.68, 7.16, and 11.43` ascend
2. 11.43-(-4.57)=16
3. let's set k=4, then bin width is 16/4=4
4. ![determine_bin](model_02_determine_bin.png)
5. bins are [-4.57 to -0.57), [-0.57, 3.43)...
6. ![fd_bin](model_02_fd_bin.png)
When build frequency distribution with bin, we can start with a relatively small bin width, we can see whether or not the bins are mostly empty and whether or not the value of k associated with that bin width is too large. If the bins are mostly empty, implying that k is too large, we can consider increasingly larger bins (i.e., smaller values of k) until we have a frequency distribution that effectively summarizes the distribution.

We turn to these issues in discussing the construction of frequency distributions for daily returns of the fictitious Euro-Asia-Africa (EAA) Equity Index. The dataset of daily returns of the EAA Equity Index spans a five-year period and consists of 1,258 observations with a minimum value of −4.1% and a maximum value of 5.0%. Thus, the range of the data is 5% − (−4.1%) = 9.1%, approximately.\
Suppose that for ease of interpretation we want to use a bin width stated in whole rather than fractional percentages. In the case of the daily EAA Equity Index returns, a 1% bin width would be associated with 9.1/1 = 9.1 bins, which can be rounded up to k = 10 bins.

## SECTION 5 SUMMARIZING DATA USING A CONTINGENCY TABLE
We have shown that the frequency distribution table is a powerful tool to summarize data for one variable. Contingency table is used to summarize data for two variables simultaneously.\
![pf](model02/model_02_pf_by_sector_market_cap.png)\
There are 275 small-cap health care stocks, making it the portfolio's largest subgroup in terms of frequency. These data are also called `joint frequencies` because you are joining one variable from the row (i.e., sector) and the other variable from the column (i.e., market cap) to count observations. The joint frequencies are then added across rows and across columns, and these corresponding sums are called `marginal frequencies`. For example, the marginal frequency of health care stocks in the portfolio is the sum of the joint frequencies across all three levels of market cap, so 435 (= 275 + 105 + 55)
