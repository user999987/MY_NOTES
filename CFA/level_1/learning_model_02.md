# Organizing, Visualizing, and Describing Data
## DATA TYPES
### Numerical versus Categorical Data
From a statistical perspective, data can be classified into two basic groups: numerical data(数值数据) and categorical data(分类数据).
1. Numerical Data: are values that represent measured or counted quantities as a number and are also called quantitative data. It can be split into continuous data and discrete data.
2. Categorical Data: (also called qualitative data) are values that describe a quality or characteristic of a group of observations and therefore can be used as labels to divide a dataset into groups to summarize and visualize.
    * Nominal data: are not amenable to being organized in a logical order. no inherent order or ranking. Like gender, color, martial status etc. Often, financial models, such as regression models, require input data to be numerical; so, nominal data in the input dataset must be coded numerically before applying an algorithm (that is, a process for problem solving) for performing the analysis. 
    * Ordinal data: are categorical values that can be logically ordered or ranked.
