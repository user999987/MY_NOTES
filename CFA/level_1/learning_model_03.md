# Probability Concepts
## S1 PROBABILITY CONCEPTS AND ODDS RATIOS
The term mutually `exclusive` means that only one event can occur at a time; `exhaustive` means that the events cover all possible outcomes.
* empirical probability: estimate the probability of an event as a relative frequency of occurrence based on historical data. This method produces an empirical probability
* subjective probability, one drawing on personal or subjective judgment.
* For many well-defined problems, we can deduce probabilities by reasoning about the problem. A priori probability, one based on logical analysis rather than on observation or personal judgment. 

Another way of stating probabilities often encountered in investments is in terms of odds—for instance, "the odds for E" or the "odds against E." (在投资中，经常遇到的另一种表达概率的方式是用赔率（odds）来表示，比如"E的赔率"或者"反对E的赔率"). The odds for an event is the probability that an event will occur divided by the probability that the event will not occur. 如果赔率为1:1，表示事件发生和不发生的可能性相等，即50%的概率。如果赔率为2:1，表示事件发生的可能性是不发生的两倍，即事件发生的概率为2/3，不发生的概率为1/3。

Odds for E = P(E)/[1-P(E)]
Odds against E = [1-P(E)]/P(E)

## S2 CONDITIONAL AND JOINT PROBABILITY
* P(A): unconditional probability 
* P(A|B): conditional probability (read: the probability of A given B, means probability of A, given that B has occurred)
* P(AB): joint probability. (read: the probability of A and B. means probability of both A and B happening)\

P(AB)=P(A|B)P(B) 乘法\ 
P(A &#8746; B)(A or B or both occur) = P(A)+P(B)-P(AB) 加法
